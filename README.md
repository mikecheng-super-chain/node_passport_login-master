Reminded that the node_modules isn't uploaded to GitHub since it's too huge. (You can just install them by yourself then all works well afterwards)

Install all node_modules needed: 'npm install'

Save and update the local host: 'npm run devStart'

Upload to GitHub: 'git add .' -> 'git commit -m "Testing"' -> 'git push'

Website: 'http://localhost:3000'
